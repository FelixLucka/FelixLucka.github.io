        Full Waveform Inversion for High Resolution 3D Ultrasonic Breast Imaging
      </a>
    </h2>

    <time datetime="2021-12-31T00:00:00+01:00" class="post-date">31 Dec 2021</time>

    <p>Ultrasound Tomography (UST) is an upcoming ultrasound modality which can generate high-resolution 3D images of acoustic tissue properties such as the speed-of-sound distribution. In particular for breast cancer imaging, this would provide extremely valuable additional diagnostic information at low operating costs without harm or discomfort to the patient. However, compared to X-ray CT, the image reconstruction is a much harder mathematical problem. I worked extensively on devising a computational strategy to improve this and recently described it in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6420/ac3b64">a paper in Inverse Problems</a>. The next step is to produce first results for breast cancer patients.</p>

        First Annual Meeting of the Dutch Inverse Problems Community
      </a>
    </h2>

    <time datetime="2021-11-30T00:00:00+01:00" class="post-date">30 Nov 2021</time>

    <p>Together with a network of colleagues from different Dutch universities, we are setting up the Dutch Inverse Problems Community - a network of researchers and professionals working in this field to increase its visibility within the applied mathematics community in the Netherlands. Unfortunately, we had to cancel the kick-off meeting that we had organized for September 2020 at CWI due to the pandemic. The second attempt we organized <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/research/groups/computational-imaging/events/inverse-problems/inverse-problems-meeting">a very successful two-day workshop in November 2021</a>. Our long-term goal is to establish an annual meeting accompanied by smaller events and position CWI in the center of these activities.</p>

    <p>We continued our work on using deep learning for ultrasound imaging and <a href="https://www.georgiospilikos.com/">Georgios Pilikos</a> just presented our current results (virtually) at the <a href="https://2021.ieee-ius.org/">2021 IEEE Symposium (IUS) Ultrasonics</a>. Check out the conference papers on an <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9593507">Deep Learning for Multi-View Ultrasonic Image Fusion</a> (<a href="https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/31205">open access link</a>) and an <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9593589">Single Plane-Wave Imaging using Physics-Based Deep Learning</a> (<a href="https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/31206">open access link</a>).

        Deep Learning for Cone Beam CT Imaging
      </a>
    </h2>

    <time datetime="2021-06-23T00:00:00+02:00" class="post-date">23 Jun 2021</time>

    <p>Over the last years, I’ve been involved in a project to improve various aspects cone-beam CT imaging using deep learning. Recently, two more papers from this work were published. <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/ac09a1/meta">One in Physics in Medicine &amp; Biology</a> proposes an efficient dimension reduction workflow to reduce high cone angle artifacts while one in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260721002662">Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine</a> compares different neural network training strategies for image segmentation. Thanks to everyone involved, in particular to Jordi Minnema!</p>

    <p>My colleague <a href="https://obi-wan.github.io/">Nicola Viganò</a> (now at ESRF) works on exciting new imaging techniques and recently got me involved in a project on developing X-ray plenoptic cameras (light-field imaging). Check out the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/6/12/138">corresponding paper</a>, which got published recently. Big thanks to Nicola and everyone involved!</p>
