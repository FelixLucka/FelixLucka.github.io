title: More Deep Learning for Ultrasound Imaging
---
 We continued our work on using deep learning for ultrasound imaging and [Georgios Pilikos](https://www.georgiospilikos.com/) just presented our current results (virtually) at the [2021 IEEE Symposium (IUS) Ultrasonics](https://2021.ieee-ius.org/). Check out the conference papers on an [Deep Learning for Multi-View Ultrasonic Image Fusion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9593507) ([open access link](https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/31205)) and an [Single Plane-Wave Imaging using Physics-Based Deep Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9593589) ([open access link](https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/31206)). Thanks to everyone involved, in particular to Georgios.
