title: New paper on EEG head modeling online
---
We just published a paper titled "The role of blood vessels in high-resolution volume conductor head modeling of EEG" in NeuroImage! It can be found [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915011544), and an image from it was elected as the cover of NeuroImage's next issue, 128. Big thanks to the first author [Lukas Fiederer](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lukas_Fiederer)!
