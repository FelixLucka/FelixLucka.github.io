title: New paper on tCS and EEG simulation
---
"Using reciprocity for relating the simulation of transcranial current stimulation to the EEG forward problem" just went into press for NeuroImage! The uncorrected proof can be found [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916300386) and on [bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/15/043554). Big thanks to the first author Sven Wagner!
