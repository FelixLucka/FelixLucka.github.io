title: Grid-Free Automatic Deformation Estimation for Cryo-Electron Tomography

---
[Poulami Somanya Ganguly](https://poulamisganguly.github.io/) extended our work on grid-free (super resolution) imaging to the problem of estimating in-scan deformation in Cryo-Electron Tomography. Check out her [paper in IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9844249)!
