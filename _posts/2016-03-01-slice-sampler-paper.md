title: New paper on fast Gibbs sampling online
---
I finally submitted a paper about the extension to the single component Gibbs sampler that allows to sample a lot more types of posteriors in Bayesian inversion. It is titled "Fast Gibbs sampling for high-dimensional Bayesian inversion" and after lying around for quite a bit as a draft, I now finalized it and submitted it to Inverse Problems. The pre-print can be found on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08595).
