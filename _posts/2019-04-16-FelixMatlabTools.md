title: Collection of MATLAB functions published
---
Over the years, I wrote a large number of all kinds of auxiliary MATLAB functions for my various projects in mathematical imaging. I recently decided to share them on  [GitHub as a toolbox](https://github.com/FelixLucka/FelixMatlabTools) and put some effort into commenting and standardizing them. Hope someone finds them useful, I will do the same with my collection of numerical optimization algorithms.
