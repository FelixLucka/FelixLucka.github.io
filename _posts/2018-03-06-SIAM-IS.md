title: Minisymposium at SIAM-IS 2018
---
Together with [Tanja Tarvainen](http://venda.uef.fi/inverse/FrontPage/People/Tanja%20Tarvainen), I organize a minisymposium on "Imaging with Light and Sound" at the [SIAM conference on Imaging Science 2018](https://www.siam-is18.dm.unibo.it/), which will take place in Bologna. It's going to be a great and exciting conference, check out the [list of all minisymposia](https://www.siam-is18.dm.unibo.it/minisymposia).
