title: Numerical methods for acoustic holography
---

My colleague [Brad Treeby](http://bug.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/bradley-treeby) from the [Biomedical Ultrasound Group (BUG)](http://bug.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/) at UCL got me involved in an interesting project that tries to find ways to numerically simulate the acoustic fields that ultrasound transducers generate in complex media. The idea is to find an equivalent interior source term that would reproduce field measurements taken in a homogeneous medium. The work let to a paper titled "Equivalent-Source Acoustic Holography for Projecting Measured Ultrasound Fields through Complex Media" which just got accepted for publication in [IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8424201/). Big thanks to Brad and the other co-authors!
