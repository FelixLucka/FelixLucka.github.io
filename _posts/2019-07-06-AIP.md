The [Applied Inverse Problems Conference (AIP)](https://www.aip2019-grenoble.fr/) will take place in Grenoble, France, this year.
Together with [Sophia Coban](https://www.cwi.nl/people/sophia-coban), [Tatiana Bubba](https://sites.google.com/view/tatianabubba/home), [Samuli Siltanen](http://www.siltanen-research.net/), I organize a minisymposium called "Tomographic Imaging: Recent Advances, Exciting Applications and New Horizons".
