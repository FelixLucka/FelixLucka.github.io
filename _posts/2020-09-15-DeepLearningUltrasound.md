title: Deep Learning for Reflection-Mode Ultrasound Imaging
---
 About a year ago we started an exciting project on using deep learning to improve various aspects of reflection-mode ultrasound imaging. I did not know much about this imaging modality up to this point and I'm happy to know a little bit more now. [Georgios Pilikos](https://www.georgiospilikos.com/) just presented our current results (virtually) at the [2020 IEEE Symposium (IUS) Ultrasonics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9251288/proceeding). Check out the conference papers on an [end-to-end deep delay-and-sum (DSA) imaging approach](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9251550) and an [end-to-end deep US data compression](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9251753). Thanks to everyone involved, in particular to Georgios.
