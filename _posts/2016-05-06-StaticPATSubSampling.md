title: New paper on Compressed Sensing for PAT
---
We just submitted our paper "Accelerated High-Resolution Photoacoustic Tomography via Compressed Sensing" to Physics in Medizin and Biology. It contains a lot of the work I did at the UCL so far. It is already [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00133). Big thanks to all the co-authors!
