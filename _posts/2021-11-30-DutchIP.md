title: First Annual Meeting of the Dutch Inverse Problems Community
---
Together with a network of colleagues from different Dutch universities, we are setting up the Dutch Inverse Problems Community - a network of researchers and professionals working in this field to increase its visibility within the applied mathematics community in the Netherlands. Unfortunately, we had to cancel the kick-off meeting that we had organized for September 2020 at CWI due to the pandemic. The second attempt we organized [a very successful two-day workshop in November 2021](https://www.cwi.nl/research/groups/computational-imaging/events/inverse-problems/inverse-problems-meeting). Our long-term goal is to establish an annual meeting accompanied by smaller events and position CWI in the center of these activities.
