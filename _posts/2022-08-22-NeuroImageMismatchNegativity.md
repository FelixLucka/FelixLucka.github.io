title: Neurocomputational models of mismatch negativity generation
---
I was involved in an exciting neuro imaging project in which [Insa Schlossmacher](https://www.medizin.uni-muenster.de/en/medpsych/institute/team/insa-schlossmacher.html) from the [ Institute of Medical Psychology and Systems Neuroscience](https://www.medizin.uni-muenster.de/en/medpsych/home.html) examined the effects of awareness and task relevance on neurocomputational models of mismatch negativity generation. The results are published in a [paper in NeuroImage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811922006450).
