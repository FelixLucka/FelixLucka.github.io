title: X-ray Light-Field Tomography
---
My colleague [Nicola Vigan√≤](https://obi-wan.github.io/) (now at ESRF) works on exciting new imaging techniques and recently got me involved in a project on developing X-ray plenoptic cameras (light-field imaging). Check out the [corresponding paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/6/12/138), which got published recently. Big thanks to Nicola and everyone involved!
