title: Simultaneous Motion Estimation for CS-PAT
---

We just submitted our second major paper on how to improve dynamic, high-resolution 3D photoacoustic tomography (4D PAT) by novel imaging techniques. It combines compressed sensing data acquisition with a generic spatio-temporal regularization framework that incorporates a PDE-based motion model. The paper can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05184), big thanks to all the co-authors!
