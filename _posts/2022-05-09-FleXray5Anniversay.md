title: 5 Years FleX-ray Anniversary
---
Our group hosts the FleX-ray Lab - a custom-made, fully-automated X-ray CT scanner linked to large-scale computing hardware. For the occasion of its 5th anniversary, I organized a [symposium](https://www.cwi.nl/events/2022/flexray-lab-5-years-anniversary) in which we looked back at some of the scientific highlights of the past years, outlined future plans and had speakers from different scientific areas that illustrated how they use X-ray CT to answer research questions and what specific imaging challenges arise from their applications. The talks can be found on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIvITQXeG_k&list=PLtBl3dSNhbhhy2RhZE7wCW35j5Ib2wDiz).
