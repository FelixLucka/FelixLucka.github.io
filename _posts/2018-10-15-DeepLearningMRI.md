title: Deep Learning for cardiac MRI
---

Together with a team of researchers and clinicians from the [Centre for Translational Cardiovascular Imaging](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cardiovascular/research/childrens-cardiovascular-disease/centre-translational-cardiovascular-imaging), Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children we started an exciting project on using deep learning to improve cardiac imaging for children with congenital heart diseases. A first proof-of-concept study on using a U-Net-type CNN for real‚Äêtime reconstruction of dynamic, under-sampled cardiovascular MR just got published in [Magnetic Resonance in Medicine](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.27480). Big thanks to the team!
