title: Deep Learning for Cone Beam CT Imaging
---
Over the last years, I've been involved in a project to improve various aspects cone-beam CT imaging using deep learning. Recently, two more papers from this work were published. [One in Physics in Medicine & Biology](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/ac09a1/meta) proposes an efficient dimension reduction workflow to reduce high cone angle artifacts while one in [Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260721002662) compares different neural network training strategies for image segmentation. Thanks to everyone involved, in particular to Jordi Minnema!
