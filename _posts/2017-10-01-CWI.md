title: New job at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica
---
I just moved to Amsterdam to pick up a tenure track position at the [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)](https://cwi.nl). With the group for [Computational Imaging](https://www.cwi.nl/research/groups/computational-imaging), headed by [Joost Batenburg](https://www.cwi.nl/people/joost-batenburg), I will work on dynamic computerized tomography (CT). Their facilities include a world class X-ray lab that allows you to design a wide range of interesting challenging experiments. Check out the [news story about the opening of the lab including a pretty cool animation](https://www.cwi.nl/news/2017/centrum-wiskunde-informatica-launches-world-class-3d-lab)
