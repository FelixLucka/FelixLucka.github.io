title: Second Annual Meeting of the Dutch Inverse Problems Community
---
After a [first successful meeting in November 2021](https://www.cwi.nl/news/2021/first-annual-meeting-of-the-dutch-inverse-problems-community), we are organizing the second annual meeting of the Dutch Inverse Problems Community for November 10-11. Like last year, the program will consist of masterclasses on the first day (aimed primarily at PhD students) followed by scientific talks on the second day. Check out the [full program](https://www.cwi.nl/research/groups/computational-imaging/events/inverse-problems-2/second-annual-meeting-for-the-dutch-inverse-problems-community).
