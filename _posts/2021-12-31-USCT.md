title: Full Waveform Inversion for High Resolution 3D Ultrasonic Breast Imaging
---
Ultrasound Tomography (UST) is an upcoming ultrasound modality which can generate high-resolution 3D images of acoustic tissue properties such as the speed-of-sound distribution. In particular for breast cancer imaging, this would provide extremely valuable additional diagnostic information at low operating costs without harm or discomfort to the patient. However, compared to X-ray CT, the image reconstruction is a much harder mathematical problem. I worked extensively on devising a computational strategy to improve this and recently described it in [a paper in Inverse Problems](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6420/ac3b64). The next step is to produce first results for breast cancer patients.
