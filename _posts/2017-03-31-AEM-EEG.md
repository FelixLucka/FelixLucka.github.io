title: Bayesian approximation error approach for EEG
---
My colleague Ville Rimpil√§inen wrote a nice conference proceedings about our work on using the Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach to compensate for errors in EEG source reconstructions caused by the inherent uncertainty in the skull conductivity. It can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09031) and he will hopefully present this work at the [European Medical and Biological Engineering Conference (EMBEC)](http://embec2017.org/) in Tampere, Finland.
