title: Majorization-minimization from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective
---

A while ago, I got involved in an interesting collaboration with [Alexandre Gramfort](http://alexandre.gramfort.net/),
[Joseph Salmon](http://josephsalmon.eu/) & [Yousra Bekhti](https://sites.google.com/site/yousrabekhti/) from the Télécom ParisTech. We drew a connection between majorization-minimization methods for sparse non-convex regression and a particular kind of hierarchical Bayesian modeling. Furthermore, we demonstrate how it can be used to quantify the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity of ill-posed regression problems such as EEG/MEG source reconstruction. The paper can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08747), big thanks to all the co-authors! [Update: [It has been published in Inverse Problems](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6420/aac9b3).]
