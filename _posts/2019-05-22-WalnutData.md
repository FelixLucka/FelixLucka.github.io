title: X-ray Data Collection for Machine Learning
---
Together with my colleagues at CWI, we just released a large collection of tomography scans designed for developing machine learning approaches to tomographic image reconstruction. All details can be found in the accompanying paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04787). We also prepared a collection of Python and MATLAB scripts for loading, pre-processing and reconstructing the data on on
[github](https://github.com/cicwi/WalnutReconstructionCodes). The complete data set is on [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)Â and can be found via the following links: [1-8](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2686725), [9-16](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2686970), [17-24](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2687386), [25-32](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2687634), [33-37](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2687896), [38-42](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2688111). A big thanks to all my colleagues, in particular to Henri der Sarkissian!
